PA2 Project description and execution guidelines.

This program is a commandline program that continually displays a menu of operations to perform and performs those operations 
based on user inputs until the user enters the exit command. The program basically manipulates elements of an underlying set 
of integers based on user input.
Please find a sample run attached.

The menu options are:
1. Insert
2. Remove
3. InsertAt
4. InsertEnd
5. ReplaceAt
6. SeqSearch
7. PrintList
8. Quit

Options 3, 4, and 5 work as required by the project requirements
The program rejects any option that's not included above.
Option 8 exits the application while any other option than 3, 4, and 5 are not are not available.

How to compile and run:
Import all attached files into an empty C++ project and build the application with the MinGW GCC toolchain or any other compiler of your choice.
Please check that the binary files are created and run the program.
